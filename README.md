DESCRIPTION OF DECISION TREE IMPLEMENTATION(A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like model of decisions.

In this implementation, we use the Iris dataset from scikit-learn, which contains measurements of iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width))
